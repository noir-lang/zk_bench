# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue.

## Contributing to an existing example project

If you would like to contribute to an existing example project, please open an issue and tag one of the original
authors or maintainers (@critesjosh, @signorecello) with your suggestion.

## Adding a new example project

We are currently not accepting new contributions with starters. However, the Noir team encourages everyone to contribute to [awesome-noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/awesome-noir).

If you want to contribute with unique ideas, check out Awesome Noir to see what's been done so far, or what's the status of each of the projects. Some unique ideas for boilerplates or examples, if you don't know where to start, would be:

- Something integrating Angular
- A React Native starter
- A Svelte example
- A server-side-rendered Go or Python app

Basically anything that combines different technologies would be adding a lot to the ecosystem. If you'd like to discuss further, please message @signorecello or @critesjosh!
